h2. Setup Instructions

Here's how you set up SimplyCivi on your site.

# Upload the "SimplyCivi" folder in this folder to your server, and place it in whatever folder you'd like. A good choice would be your CSS folder.
# Add the following three lines to every @<head/>@ of your site. Make sure the three @href@ paths are correct (here, BP is in my CSS folder): <pre><code>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/SimplyCivi/screen.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/SimplyCivi/print.css" type="text/css" media="print">
<!--[if lt IE 8]>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/SimplyCivi/ie.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection">
<![endif]--></code></pre>
Remember to include trailing slashes (" />") in these lines if you're using XHTML.
# For development, add the .showgrid class to any container or column to see the underlying grid. Check out the @plugins@ directory for more advanced functionality.

This file resets CSS values that browsers tend to set for you.

This file sets some default print rules, so that printed versions of your site looks better than they usually would. It should be included on every page.
